After fingerprinting, college entrance examination introduced a new technique can distinguish--finger vein recognition.On March 8, the Ministry of Education issued the notice on enrollment of colleges and universities in 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the notice), and requirements around the actual measures such as fingerprinting or a vein can be used to prevent exam, is quite interesting.According to the Word Press (www.thepaper.CN) understanding, fingerprinting has been used in several provinces in the entrance examination, and finger vein recognition is a technology to identify greater security, using the principles of hemoglobin in the blood to absorb infrared light, collect blood into the structure of the image that are not visible to the naked eye, as a basis for identification.![Alt Entrance of your exam to check \"means a vein\" is: identify candidates refers to blood in the trend graphic](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1542/25662521776_1cc21d1b10.jpg)Fingerprint membranesFingerprint identification has been used by several provinces and the remaining provinces has yet to follow up measures [Chinese Academy of Sciences doctoral students](http://www.eastbuzz.com/2016/01/17/chinese-academy-of-sciences-doctoral-students-death-medical-malpractice-hospitals/)According to the news about the surging, at present, Guangdong, Sichuan, Liaoning, Henan and other provinces have taken measures to fingerprint identification to identify candidates. [Chinese Academy of Sciences doctoral students](http://www.eastbuzz.com/2016/01/17/chinese-academy-of-sciences-doctoral-students-death-medical-malpractice-hospitals/)Candidates in front of the entrance examination, you need to specify location, through specialized equipment, card information, personal information recorded on the face. After the check, right hands respectively presses on the authentication machine, typing fingerprint information. Scene of the college entrance examination, examinee\'s fingerprints must be compatible with the input before storing fingerprints, admittance fee to take the examination.There are some provinces had not yet introduced fingerprint identification. According to Hubei provincial education examinations a admission office staff revealed that Hubei is not currently relevant measures, \"to buy supplies, gather information, which is to spend time and project, not to say can do, this year is less likely to (introduce). ”In the other provinces are not fingerprinted, in front of the entrance to your identity and facial information input, in order to discern candidates \' authenticity.Liyang, Jiangsu Province, Chen served as Proctor in middle school, according to his recollection, candidates in front of the entrance was assigned uniform photo and entry systems. Before the start of the college entrance examination, invigilating teacher will have a piece of paper in his hand, above the photo and basic information on the candidates. \"We mainly verify information on identity cards, photos and live face compare. ”Fingerprint recognition is not a panacea, security vulnerabilities from inundation According to the news about the surging, most of the fingerprint identification technology, laser shot was on the fingers on fingerprint, fingerprint-concave laser on the surface of reflecting back on the induction plate, forming a picture, then fingerprint picture and compare collected fingerprints before judgment.In daily life, fingerprinting has been used fingerprint, smart phone fingerprint to unlock to work are common. But fingerprinting is not everything, there are still loopholes.On one hand, under the influence of ambient temperature and individual skin, there may be some fingerprints easily, on the fingerprints due to the exposed surface, that can be copied.From the network \"fingerprint membranes\" sells one or two. Fingerprints fingerprint membranes using high-tech nano-materials, and collecting the fingerprint into the template with silicone molding.Good fingerprint material, can be colorless, odorless, and concealed. In 2014 of the CCTV news broadcast exposure in entrance exam of Henan, the Gunners are fingerprint membranes over your finger, fooled the validation machine.Expert: finger vein recognition is finger vein blood flow mapsIf the fingerprint is identified finger surface, vein recognition is to identify the internal muscular interstices.\"Finger vein recognition input, texture maps is finger vein blood flow. \"Long-term study on finger vein recognition of national defense science and Technology University of electronic science and engineering, Professor Xie Jianbin has said in in an interview with the Changsha daily, nudt vein recognition technology was developed using the principles of hemoglobin in the blood to absorb infrared light, collect blood into the structure of the image that are not visible to the naked eye, as a basis for identification.\"Blood hidden in the skin, is not easy to copy. Vein recognition security very high. \"Xie Jianbin explain that blood is living with, vein recognition is essentially a living donor recognition. \"Internationally recognized its uniqueness and characteristics of retinal, refused the truthful (same structure, recognized by the algorithm is not the same as) less than one out of 10,000 cases, general rate (not the same chart, recognized by the algorithm into the same) can also be less than one in 100,000. ”In 2015, the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the first to use finger vein biometric technology to verify information about university entrance exam candidates, a group of \"gunmen\" turned away. At present, the finger vein recognition is a hot trend, Xie Jianbin is very optimistic about its prospects, many domestic companies, schools and research institutions in research, to seize the market.
