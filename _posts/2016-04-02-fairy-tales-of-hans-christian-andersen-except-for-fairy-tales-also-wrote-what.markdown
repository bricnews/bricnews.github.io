Stubborn and he restrained her, in remembrance of the past, quarrel broke out once again, finally, Anderson wrote both men cried, Antonio, \"shouted grief to one sentence, and burst into tears. I did not sleep a wink the night, this is a sad night. \" When waking up feeling the burning love, Antonio wanted to go back to see her again, only to learn that she has moved and emptied out and disappeared in the crowd.Tried to reason, levied in a loss that \"pensive\" people tell a love story, makes one feel like drinking a glass of wine, maybe this is the daughter of the sea-a fairy tale world\'s causes.Not feeling strong, Andersen is also very keen to describe in the novel Italy, volcanic scenery, vineyards, to view detailed maps, people seemed to be able to read a colorful painting from the text, this emotional stretch even more strongly, the same moments in the old lovers meet, Anderson, tracing her family: \"gate darkness. Madonna in front of lights has gone out, leaving only the Dim glow candle-wick, like a drop of blood. \"A few pens, every decline of youthful romance and finally on the wane.Anderson\'s dreams and dramaCompared to novels and poems, Anderson in his childhood, locks, and the drama of fate. Anderson\'s father was a local a poor Shoemaker, he wants children to receive a good education, so he bought his son a lot of books and reading to him, in these works, including comedy writer Hober comedy, he also produced doll stage, allowing Anderson to fly freely in the \"fantasy\" of the world.When older, parents began taking him to the city\'s Grand Theatre, they sit in the cheap seats, nor do they know German drama, but the dreams of childhood exposure to inspire Anderson\'s play. In order to realize this dream in adulthood, came to Copenhagen, desperately wanted to take root in the Royal theatre.However, from the ugly duckling becomes a Swan\'s journey, there are a lot of scorn and ridicule. In experienced unsparing criticism and pain after school, and finally, in 1829, Andersen in Copenhagen downtown is a church bell tower as a prototype of the ruins, writing the script of the nigulayi Bell Tower of love. The show was a big success, his dramas the real race. Later in life, he has written more than 50 volumes of plays.At that time, his play is a smash hit, and in Copenhagen, a popular theater kaxinnuo theater that private, as long as the campaign with \"Hans Christian Andersen\" name, must be a sell-out. However, similar to many contemporary playwrights, 19th century, accompanied by a new philosophy, art, concept, and the emergence of the film, their plays never rehearsed in the theatre, which led to even today in Anderson\'s hometown, many people do not know who have made outstanding contributions in the field of play.Taking Anderson\'s literary life, perhaps the phrase \"an untended flowers do not open, inadvertently planted Willow\" old saying, amazing and a little helpless.
