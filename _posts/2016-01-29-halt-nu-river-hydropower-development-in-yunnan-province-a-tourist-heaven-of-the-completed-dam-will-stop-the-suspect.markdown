In December 2015, online news out halt nu River hydropower of Yunnan, Yunnan province, Li jiheng\'s position is the first official publicly confirm this.\"From the past, small hydropower in Yunnan nujiang River local government supporters, of these projects is they now make such a statement, it is a positive sign. \"Against the nujiang River\" cascade \"hydropower expert, China Institute of water conservancy and hydropower water mechanics Institute Professor-level senior engineer Liu Shukun surging News (www.thepaper.CN), Yunnan province, the official\'s position is a very big change, was welcome.Surveyed the nu River Dam project, opponents said, hoping to start final construction of dams. But some people in the industry think that the dam would not be affected.Stop synchronization and ecological management of small hydropowerAccording to news agency reports, Li jiheng, January 25 in the 11th session of the fourth session of the Commission, Committee of Yunnan province constituency, the group said, will stop all kinds of small hydropower development of nujiang, Yunnan province, promoting the nujiang Grand Canyon National Park, making it a tourist paradise.On December 6, 2015, Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and Government held in Lushui County nujiang LISU autonomous prefecture, crucial for poverty eradication work report meeting, Li jiheng also had a similar position, but the word is the position in the two sessions eased.According to national National Affairs Committee official website published of Conference reported, Li jiheng at stressed, to insisted engineering governance and natural repair phase combined, implementation good natural forest resources protection engineering, implementation good new a round returning also forest, ensure 25 degrees above of steep to all returning also forest, with foot with live National Park policy, stop SHP, and small mine development mining, solid advance energy-saving emissions and pollution governance, strengthening land utilization and regulation planning, in protection ecological environment upper and lower death defying stunts.From these reports, \"stop SHP\" and complement environmental governance of nujiang, Yunnan province.Himalayas in nujiang River originates in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, is one of the most natural waterways in Asia, middle and lower reaches of the river natural fall between 1578 m, exploitable installed capacity of 21.32 million-kilowatt, annual output of more than 100 billion degrees. The past 10 years, because there are serious disputes between the ecological environment and hydropower development, River Canyon becomes the focus of attention.Anger in Jiangzhou and rich tourist resources, apart from the unique Canyon landscape, outside the three parallel rivers world nature heritage, also owns Dulong, Nu and lisu, Pumi and other unique ethnic customs and culture. However, throughout the country is a very special case of nujiang, 98% per cent of the land area are mountains and valleys, very inconvenient traffic conditions, reclamation coefficient less than 4%.\"Going out first day, crossing by cableway, farm by Slingshot, harvest by monkeys. \"More than 10 times out of Nu Li jiheng said at the preceding session, most of it is living in the nujiang River Canyon true portrayal. Stop all kinds of small hydro, small mine development, ecological protection, declared National Park, \"this place developed from protection.\"\"Nu River tributaries have built out of SHP basic\"Small hydropower in Yunnan on attitude suddenly making such a major change? Some environmentalists believe that apart from local government outside of growing emphasis on environmental protection, River Canyon is perhaps the most immediate cause of tourism development. [China has recently invited the Government and](http://www.eastbuzz.com/2015/12/20/china-has-recently-invited-the-government-and-the-opposition-representatives/)\"Since the River Canyon National Park, and hydropower development are contradictory, National Park to some extent, must emphasize its environmental integrity and original. \"Convenor of the environmental group green home Wang Yongchen surging on news analysis said.In 2008, the Yunnan province, became China\'s first pilot province for the construction of the National Park, 8 projects such as River Canyon into the list of the first batch of pilot national park but River Canyon National Park Declaration has lagged behind the other pilot.\"Development put forward in 2003, Nu has been 13 years, today proposed to stop the construction of Yunnan hydropower and build national parks is based on this 13 years, experts, civil society organizations to work together. \"Wang Yongchen says.In August 2003, the national development and Reform Commission assessment adopted by the Yunnan province, completed under the auspices of the lower reaches of the nujiang River hydropower planning report.

Starting with this, environmental organizations and relevant experts for 13 years with the hydropower development of the game.Small and medium hydropower of the nujiang River tributary in the debate never stops. According to the Xinhua News Agency reported in September 2014, from 2004 to 2014, new small hydropower in nujiang 57, installed 1.066 million kW, and by 2015, ensure that small hydropower installed capacity of more than 1.2 million-kilowatt in the State, while the State can adapt to nu about SHP scale of 2 million-kilowatt in the carrying capacity of the environment.\"The hydropower of the nujiang River tributaries has largely been built up. \"Long-term interest nu River hydropower exploitation of Hengduan Mountain Research Association Yang Yong, surging on news that.Mainstream dams go from here?Number of nujiang River hydropower projects against surging news that, officials in Yunnan province on the growing importance of environmental protection is one of the reasons for the announcement to stop the development of nujiang River hydropower, in addition, the emergence of local small hydropower \"water\", \"Wo\" also makes the development of nujiang River Hydropower is not necessary.Yang Yong, nujiang River hydropower development in previous years is fast, small hydro formed a certain scale, but there is no power, there has been a problem of power to dissolve. \"Later dissolve on the spot, one is the development of a conservation-oriented industry, mainly for mining development pattern of mining linkage, and the other is actively seeking power, power grid construction. \"But the absorptive power schemes have not been able to implement.Yang explained, on the one hand because of the nu River hydropower construction to advance very slowly, or even a period of stagnation, power grid construction not started up small power stations to grid. The other hand, because the entire mining industry slump, mine electric linkage industry also failed to form. \"Although the rich mineral resources of nujiang River, but mineral forms are scattered, due to the lack of geological exploration, mineral resource development are not in place, mining industry did not form. ‚ÄùYunnan province, according to the scenario, small hydropower and small mines development must work together to stop.After the moratorium on construction of small hydropower, existing small hydropower project will do? \"A large part of SHP may be phased out. In tributaries can provide energy for local, reducing damage to the minority areas for wood, vegetation should be reserved to meet local needs (SHP). \"Liu Shukun believes that eventually because of the natural elimination of small hydropower, nujiang River tributary ecological gradually recovered.Supports the development of nujiang River hydropower experts to agree to the embarrassing situation of the nujiang River hydropower, but they stressed that the nujiang River as a large hydroelectric project will not be affected.\"As far as I know the nu River Dam project has so far not been affected, stop small hydropower projects more economic considerations, the SHP \' water, \' the situation is very serious, there is no benefit. \"The Deputy Secretary General of China Society for hydropower engineering Zhang Boting surging on news.\"This gives us some hope, Nu is likely to be preserved. \"Liu Shukun said.Surveyed the nu River Dam project, opponents said, hopes the moratorium on small hydropower as a starting point, and finally put an end to all of nujiang River hydropower development.
