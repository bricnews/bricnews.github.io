![Alt Voxel Vision: virtual reality 3D imaging technology](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1639/26026980346_81474d27ba_m.jpg)Voxel Vision is by United States Stanford University student jrod, benjen and Deniz created an open hardware project, aims to enable people to see things inside and behind the scenes. Virtual reality 3D imaging technology, so that human beings will be able to see with the naked eye 3-dimensional virtual reality projects.![Alt Voxel Vision: virtual reality 3D imaging technology](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1443/26026989476_1d14d091fe.jpg)3 key technologies[![Alt DKNY iPhone 6+ cases](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/dkny_iphone6_i6p2503_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/dkny-iphone-6-plus-case-rose-p-4998.html)  1, through the horizontal angle (PHI), vertical angle (Theta) three spherical coordinates and RADIUS track user eye, determine its sight radius.![Alt Voxel Vision: virtual reality 3D imaging technology](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1521/25450354773_814e5a39a8_z.jpg)After 2 RADIUS, knows the user\'s eyes, to translucent object rendering, presents a different perspective.

Such screens + lens combinations are called virtual retinal display.
