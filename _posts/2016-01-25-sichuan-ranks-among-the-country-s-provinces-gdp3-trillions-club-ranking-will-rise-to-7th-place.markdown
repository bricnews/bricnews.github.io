Among them, more than 6 trillion yuan, Guangdong and Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Henan between between 3 trillion and 6 trillion yuan. Hebei 2.9421 trillion yuan, Liaoning was 2.8627 trillion yuan, 2.8547 trillion yuan, Sichuan, have for the 2015 impact the possibility of 3 trillion yuan.\"The Sichuan into the 3 trillion Club, is also a development of national economic trends. \"South-regional economic expert he mingxia told interface news, first in the new round of economic restructuring in China, lack of heavy industry in Sichuan earlier but will turn into advantage and leaping upgrade adjustments.However, the interface News noted that in the first three quarters of the national GDP rankings, actually rank in Sichuan and some before, was sixth. Sichuan Provincial Bureau officials explained that each province\'s industrial structure is very different, leading to seasonal differences in local economic growth. For example, a big agricultural province, higher growth in the fall; but industry accounts for higher, faster growth in the fourth quarter. To this end, the Bureau of the general economy is not in a quarter of the province\'s total ranking. Especially adjacent to rank, and there is little difference between the provinces.The first three quarters, leading the total GDP in Hebei more than 80 billion yuan in Sichuan, Hubei and Liaoning lead is only about 170 billion yuan, and ended the year ranked down but was twice came from Hebei province.He mingxia analysis indicated that in the short run, benefit from the \"Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development\" and other national strategies, since the second half of last year, Hebei\'s economic growth in a stable situation. Bureau in Hebei province said Hebei service industry is developing fast, contribution to the economic growth rate of more than 4 consecutive quarter at 50%, restructuring the early results. Widely seen, Hebei\'s economy is bottoming out. Also, because of the real estate market picks up, the steel market gradually stabilizing, Hebei quarter beyond Sichuan back in sixth place.Long term, ranking seventh place in Sichuan province, indeed, are a threat. Between Hubei and Sichuan there are gaps of more than 100 billion yuan, but higher than in Sichuan, and accelerating trend, in this context, if we don\'t step in Sichuan, Hubei ahead is likely to be.In addition, the adjustment of industrial structure in Sichuan is still a long way to go. In recent years, the economic structure of the country, has been a West to East trend, but recently there have been new changes. The first three quarters, judging from the economic aggregate ranked top five provinces, in addition to the growth of 7.9% in Guangdong Province, enrolled in Sichuan, but the remaining four provinces are equal or higher than the Sichuan and Sichuan, especially Jiangsu, although total GDP over 5 trillion, but growth is still higher than the Sichuan 0.5%. [Led to nearly three years of international industry](http://www.hubgold.com/2015/12/30/led-to-nearly-three-years-of-international-industry-transfer-export-95-billion/)Zhejiang Provincial Bureau released first-half economic data shows that Zhejiang in recent years to \"Internet +\" as representative, in a new format, new products, new technologies, new business models, new economy as the representative of the industry, significant achievements were made. These new economy leading the rising power of emerging growth, up to overcapacity of traditional manufacturing and heavy industry leading downward pressure.He mingxia believes that such a situation shows that eastern coastal provinces after several years of difficult adjustment, transformation and achieved marked progress, economic obvious conversion of kinetic energy. In contrast, the restructuring and conversion of kinetic energy in Sichuan is still in progress.\"In new normal economic background Xia, Sichuan economic of development just caters to has new of national economic development trend, that modern agricultural and modern services for representative of primary and tertiary industry Fusion will has more big of development space, makes Sichuan into GDP3 trillion Club, but to keep this copies results, future to using agricultural big province advantage, again high cut Internet + and culture + two big platform, go more ecological more health more human of development of road. \"He mingxia said.
