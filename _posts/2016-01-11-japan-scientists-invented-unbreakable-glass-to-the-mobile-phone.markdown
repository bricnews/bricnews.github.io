By shock fragmentation of glass, this is common sense, of course, but scientists at the University of Tokyo, will use his new invention to change it, making almost no broken glass.![Alt Japan scientists invented unbreakable glass to the mobile phone](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1463/24009155270_ac0b51304b_b.jpg)　　New broken glass is not saying never, but its strength can reach the level of steel. If the glass gets into production, is not only the construction and car manufacturing, our phones, tablets will also benefit. Imagine a phone screen unbreakable, careless of the Gospel.　　Make the secret of this glass is alumina, which mixed silica significantly increases the strength of the glass. In fact, this is not a new idea, however in previous attempts, the mixture once you hit the container will crystallize, but unable to form glass form.

Tokyo University research team\'s solution is simple and brutal: it would have been without the container. They will Jet out of the mixture to make it direct response in the air. This method results in an exception, and glass is not only strong, thin and transparent.　　Scientists have expressed the hope that in 5 years production the glass, we can also look forward to a future of phone screen unbreakable.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: mobile phone Science and technology [Kenzo case](http://www.nodcase.com/kenzo-iphone-6-case-field-flowers-p-4148.html)If you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
