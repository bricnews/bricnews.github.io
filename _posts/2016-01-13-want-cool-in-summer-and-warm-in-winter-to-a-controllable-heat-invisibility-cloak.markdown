Invisibility Cloak was once thought to exist only in Harry Potter or Star Trek science-fiction plot, the cloaking device is mainly based on guiding light in the object continues to spread around the principle of build, and as long as the light is not blocked, it would never be found out.　　In fact, in addition to light, this principle is also applied to sound waves, thus, stealth equipment will be able to avoid sonar detection. Recently, researchers say, they have successfully developed a new type of heat \"invisibility cloak\" that can allow users in a cool State.![Alt Want cool in summer and warm in winter? To a controllable heat \"invisibility cloak\"](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1496/24346337665_aca6d63246_z.jpg)　　In previous studies, researchers have succeeded in creating the hidden objects will heat \"hidden\" cloaking device, however, the invisibility cloak does not support opening and closing, can only be kept in stealth State. In addition, the Cape must be tailored, very inconvenient to use.　　This new type of heat \"invisibility cloak\", co-author of the research, Singapore Nanyang Technological University physicist and electrical engineer Baile Zhang in an interview said: \"invisibility cloak in the actual application process, you need to consider changes in environment and hidden objects. They may change at any time, so a control, you can adjust the properties of the cloak is very desirable. ” [star wars case](http://www.nodcase.com/star-wars-iphone-6-case-p-10619.html)　　It is understood that Baile Zhang and his colleagues have developed a proactive open and closed heat \"invisibility cloak\", and can be achieved without prejudice to its stealth properties of case change the shape of the Cape. This cloak made up of 24 known as the thermoelectric module device, each module dimensions 6x3.8x6 mm, they like the pumps move heat from one place to another.　　This cloak after the opening, to 2.44 inches (62 mm) wide heat transfer of hot air around the hole to a thickness of only 0.2 inch (5 mm) steel plate. It can prevent heat diffusion in 0-60 degrees Celsius temperature range. According to researchers, the thermoelectric module also can function after you rearrange the 2.36-inch (60 mm) rectangular hot air over the hole.　　Baile Zhang said that theoretically, the controlled-calorie invisibility cloak could do with skin as thin as it can protect your mobile device chip, high-power engine and magnetic resonance imaging scanner (MRI) and other sensitive electronic components.[![Alt star wars case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/star_wars_i64620_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/star-wars-iphone-6-case-p-10619.html)　　In a statement, he said, the cloak can also be used in people\'s clothing, and to achieve effective cooling and warming effect, which live in Singapore, people in the tropics, is good news. In addition, Baile Zhang added, it also applies to the telescopic antenna is needed to change the shape of the satellite.　　At present, this future technology is still in the early stages. Although research has shown that the possibility of controlled thermal camouflage, but this cloak is not a finished product, the researchers still need years to work into the current cooling technologies.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542 [star wars iPhone 6 cases](http://cathkidstoncase.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-pr-newswire-follow-up-to-wu-sheng.html)Tags: Science and technology DesignIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
